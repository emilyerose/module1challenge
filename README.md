# Horiseon Refactor

## Description
The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with semantic html elements, and to increase my awareness of the repeatability of CSS code
I added semantic html to the webpage and added image alt text for accessibility purposes, and learned how to use such elements as figure, article, and section.

## Installation
To install this project, clone it from github and run index.html in browser OR to view the webpage, access the live github link. 

## Usage
This website (refactored) looks almost exactly like the original base code version of the website. Small changes were made for accessibility purposes: the sidebar background color, for example, was darkened to increase the text/background contrast. 

This is the original coloring:

And this is the modified coloring:
